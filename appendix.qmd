# Appendix B: Commentary

I used the LLM’s outline and some text structure, but I revised all content based on my actual education, work experience, and skills. I changed the bio to reflect my recent work as a Sales Associate and updated the education and skills sections with real information. I used my own tone to make it sound more professional and authentic.
